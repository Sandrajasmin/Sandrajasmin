### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Sandra!
I'm a 29-year-old former store manager turned aspiring developer. I have a passion for design and believe that functionality and aesthetics should go hand in hand. When I'm not coding, you can find me learning new things, traveling, or fueling my caffeine addiction.

This year, I'm excited to challenge myself by creating a visually appealing tic tac toe game. Follow my progress and feel free to provide feedback or collaborate on this project.
