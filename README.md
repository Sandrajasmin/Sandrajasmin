# About Me 🧑

Hi, I'm Sandra! I'm a 29-year-old former store manager turned aspiring developer. I have a passion for design and believe that functionality and aesthetics should go hand in hand. When I'm not coding, you can find me learning new things 🤓, traveling 🌍, or fueling my caffeine addiction ☕.

# Current Project 💻

This year, I'm excited to challenge myself by creating a visually appealing tic tac toe game 🎮. Follow my progress and feel free to provide feedback or collaborate on this project.
